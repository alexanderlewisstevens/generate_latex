Many video games incorporate nutrition and resource management as gameplay elements. For example, survival games often require players to monitor their character's hunger and thirst, gather food, and cook meals to maintain health and stamina. Some games use food items to provide temporary buffs or restore energy.

Game designers sometimes research real-world nutrition to create believable in-game food systems, balancing realism with fun and challenge for players.
