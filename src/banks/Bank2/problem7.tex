% Example problem 7
\question Let:
x1 = amount of bean 1
x2 = amount of bean 2
….
xn = amount of bean n

A1 = amino acid profile of bean 1
A2 = amino acid profile of bean 2
…
An = amino acid profile of bean n

r = desired ratio of protein intake from beans to total protein intake
t = total protein intake required

The optimization model can be formulated as follows:

Minimize:
Total cost of beans = c1x1+c2x2+….+cnxn

Subject to:
r*(A1x1+ A2x2+….+Anxn) = t

x1,x2,…,xn >= 0

Explanation:
The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of the combination of beans chosen for the meal.

The constraint ensures that the ratio of protein intake from beans to total protein intake is equal to the desired ratio. This is represented by multiplying the amino acid profile of each bean with its corresponding amount and taking the sum, and then comparing it to the required total protein intake multiplied by the desired ratio.

The non-negativity constraint ensures that the amount of each bean chosen for the meal is greater than or equal to zero.

The optimal solution to this model will give the combination of beans that meets the required protein intake with the desired ratio at the lowest cost.
