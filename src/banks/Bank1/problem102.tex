\question[10] What is a unique characteristic of beans that sets them apart from other legumes?
\begin{solution}
Beans have the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through a mutualistic relationship with bacteria in their roots. This means that beans can convert nitrogen gas from the air into a form of nitrogen that plants can use for growth. This process not only benefits the beans, but also helps to improve the overall health and fertility of the soil.
