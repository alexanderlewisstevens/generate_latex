\question Calculate the percentage of protein, carbohydrates, and fat in 1 cup of cooked black beans.
\begin{solution}
According to the USDA, 1 cup of cooked black beans (approximately 172 grams) contains: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 15 grams of protein
    \item 41 grams of carbohydrates
    \item 0.6 grams of fat 
\end{itemize}

To calculate the percentage of each macronutrient, we first need to find the total number of grams in 1 cup of black beans. The total grams is given by the sum of protein, carbohydrates, and fat, which is 15 + 41 + 0.6 = 56.6 grams. 

To find the percentage of protein, we divide the grams of protein by the total grams and multiply by 100. This gives us (15/56.6)*100 = 26.51\%. Therefore, 1 cup of cooked black beans contains approximately 26.51\% protein. 

Similarly, to find the percentage of carbohydrates, we divide the grams of carbohydrates by the total grams and multiply by 100. This gives us (41/56.6)*100 = 72.46\%. Therefore, 1 cup of cooked black beans contains approximately 72.46\% carbohydrates. 

Lastly, to find the percentage of fat, we divide the grams of fat by the total grams and multiply by 100. This gives us (0.6/56.6)*100 = 1.06\%. Therefore, 1 cup of cooked black beans contains approximately 1.06\% fat. 

Therefore, the nutritional breakdown of 1 cup of cooked black beans is:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 26.51\% protein
    \item 72.46\% carbohydrates 
    \item 1.06\% fat 
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
